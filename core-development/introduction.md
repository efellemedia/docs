# Core Development

## Assumed Knowledge
As FusionCMS is built on top of Laravel, working knowledge of Laravel is a must. If you are new to Laravel, you will want to ensure that you understand some core fundamentals of programming in PHP such as [object oriented programming](http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.php), [namespaces](http://php.net/manual/en/language.namespaces.php) and package management through [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

For supplemental learning, we highly recommend both [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com/) and [CodeCourse](https://www.codecourse.com/).
