# Getting Started
We're so excited to have you develop on our platform! Getting started with development couldn't be easier. We have a niftly little Artisan command to help get you started:

```
php artisan make:module MyAwesomeAddon
```

This will run you through a few standard questions about your module. Once you've answered everything, you'll find a tidy little directory for your module within the `modules` directory. Don't hesitate to jump right in!
