# Getting Started
Getting started developing your own module is easy. We've even bundled an Artisan command that performs all the scaffolding work for you, allowing you to just jump right in to the task at hand.

```
php artisan make:module YourModule
```

This will ask you a few questions about your module, like its name, description, and starting version. And don't worry, all of the information gathered during this step can be customized and changed later!
