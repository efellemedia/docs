# Module Development

<doc-hero>
Modules are the means of extending the structure and feature set of FusionCMS. With modules, you may add your own sections to the control panel, add fieldsets, database tables, new console commands, and anything else your heart desires (or your business requires).

Just like the core of the CMS, modules build off of the excellent Laravel framework. If you're comfortable with Laravel, you'll have no trouble jumping into developing your own modules.
