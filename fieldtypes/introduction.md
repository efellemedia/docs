# Fieldtypes

Fieldtypes are at the heart of what makes FusionCMS so flexible. Most traditional CMS' have pre-defined database structures that content must be written to fit into. FusionCMS takes the opposite approach, allowing the content editors, developers, and designers to structure websites based on the needs of the content.

Everything associated with content in FusionCMS will have the ability to set fields using fieldtypes. Note however, that some fields are not compatible with some content types. You will find more information on this in the relevant documentation for each fieldtype.
