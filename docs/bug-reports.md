Whenever you find a bug in FusionCMS or any of our core applications, we kindly ask you to report it. It helps us make a better platform for everyone.

Before submitting a bug report, please keep the following in mind:

- Double-check the documentation to see if you're not misusing the platform.
- Ask for assistance in the `#help-dev` channel on Slack.

If your problem definitely looks like a bug, report it to the our [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/efellemedia/fusioncms/issues) and follow these simple rules:

- Use the title field to clearly describe the issue.
- Describe the steps needed to reproduce the bug with short code examples if needed.
- Provide any relevant error logs in your report.
- Give as much detail as possible about your environment (OS, PHP Version, FusionCMS version, etc.)
