# Documentation

[[toc]]

---

Contributions to documentation must follow these standards to match the style and tone of the rest of the FusionCMS documentation.

## Files and Directories
- When referencing directories, always add a trailing slash to avoid confusion with regular files (e.g. "execute the `console` script located in the `app/` directory").
- When referencing file extensions explicitly, you should include a leading dot for every extension (e.g. "XML files use the `.xml` file extension").
- When you list a file/directory hierarchy, use `your-project` as the top level directory. E.g.
  ```
  your-project/
  ├─ assets/
  ├─ resources/
  ├─ views/
  └─ ...
  ```

## English Language Standards
FusionCMS documentation uses the United States English dialect, commonly called [American English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English). The [American English Oxford Dictionary](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/american_english/) is used as the vocabulary reference.

In addition, documentation follows these rules:

- **Section titles:** use a variant of the title case, where the first word is always capitalized and all other words are capitalized, except for the closed-class words.
  E.g.: The Vitamins are in my Fresh California Raisins
- **Pronouns:** avoid the use of [nosism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosism) and always use *you* instead of *we*. (i.e. avoid the first person point of view: use the second instead);
- **Gender-neutral language:** when referencing a hypothetical person, such as "*a user with a session cookie*", use gender-neutral pronouns (they/their/theme). For example, instead of:
  - he or she, use they
  - him or her, use them
  - his or her, use their
  - his or hers, use theirs
  - himself or herself, use themselves
