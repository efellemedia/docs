# References

FusionCMS comes with a plethora of various helper methods and means to pull and manipulate data based on any need. This set of reference documentation will go over everything available to you included as part of the core platform.

The documentation is split into the following sections:

### Helpers
Most of the functionality you'll have access to in the CMS will be wrapped in what we call *helpers*. Helpers are simply global functions available to you to be used anywhere in your code to perform actions or query data from the CMS.

### Models
Models provide the necessary means to query data from the CMS. This section will go over each core model available, as well as what attributes and methods are available off of each one.

### Support
Under the support section, you'll find references to each of the more common support classes used throughout both the CMS and within themes, such as collections and form builder.
